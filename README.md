This was the Swarm AI simulation for my Aston University Individual Project module in my final year. This tries to simulate how a swarm searches for and then guides survivors back to safety in a disaster scenario (specifically a flooded town).

The first screen shows simulation information, controls, and how you want to set up the simulation with search type, simulation area size, how many survivors, and how many drones (UAVs) of each type.
The simulation will then run to its completion (hopefully).
Finally the end screen will appear showing the recorded stats from the simulation and whether you want to close the simulation or start a new one with the settings you inputted at the start.
